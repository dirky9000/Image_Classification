# Deep CNN Image Classifier
### This is a deep CNN image classifier that is able to distinguish between weeds and cultivated plants (not weeds). This project also allows the input of new images to test and can also be changed to distinguish between many different types of classes and not just the use case of agriculture. This all works on VS Code.
